# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to list and provide context and considerations for the Hiking Band product. 

The document MAY provide overview level of the used integration methods for the system. However, the main scope of the specifications SHOULD be targeted towards the actual use case. 

## Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations

The specification follows the requirement level keywords defined in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119):

|     Keyword      |      Description for the specification     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MUST             | Absolute requirement for the specification |
| MUST NOT         | Absolute prohibition of the specification  |
| SHOULD           | Can be ignored with valid reasons          |
| SHOULD NOT       | Can be implemented with valid reasons      |
| MAY              | Optional, extra                            |

# Specific Requirements

## Functional Requirements
This subsection contains the functional requirements for the Hiking Application prototype. As the prototype consists of both LilyGo - application and the Web application to present tracking data, the functional requirements gather requirements for both of these.  

### LilyGo application: Start & stop hiking sessions

The system SHALL allow user to start a hiking session  

The system SHALL allow user to stop a hiking session  

### LilyGo application: Record steps count and convert into travelled distance during the session

While hiking session is active the system SHALL record steps count  

While hiking session is active the system SHALL display step count on display  

While hiking session is active the system SHALL convert steps count into travelled distance after each step  


### LilyGo application: Display this data on a smartwatch screen

While hiking session is active the system SHALL display step count on display  

While hiking session is active the system SHALL display travelled distance on display  

### Synchronize and store data with RPi via Bluetooth



### Calculate estimated amount of calories burned during the session on RPi

The system SHALL calculate estimated amount of calories based on travelled distance


### Initialize Web UI and show last session statistics (travelled distance, step count and burned calories)




### MUST have user interface

- The system MUST provide instantaneous feedback on current activity

- The system MUST have a user interface with viewable calory and step count.

## Interfaces

## Performance Requirements

### MUST have acceptably long data synchronization

## Design Constraints

### MUST use atleast predefined hardware

- The system MUST use T-Watch V2 or V3

- The system MUST use raspberry pi 2, 3 or 3+

- The system MAY use other hardware 

## Software-system Attributes

### MUST be able to log reliably

- The system MUST log and save the current activity in periodically
