## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to list and provide context and considerations for the Hiking Band product system. This document SHOULD be used within software development, integration and testing of the whole system.  

The core audiences for this documents are the product development team and the course instructors, who both review this document and review the final system in based on the requirement specification of this document. The final product MUST match this documentation. 


## Scope

The LilyGo Hiking band system includes a LilyGO T-Watch smartwatch application for recording hiking trips and a separate application for storing trip information into persistent storage and for displaying trip information on a Web Application.  

The system consists of two hardware components: the Raspberry Pi and the LilyGo watch. The system includes interactable interfaces, hardware, protocols and functionalities which are required for the system to function. This document defines the requirements in well detail to give a broad understanding of the product and its use case. 


## Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations

### Definitions

**1.user:** the person, or persons, who operate or interract directly with the product.  

**2.hiking session:** an event during which activity data such as step count, travelled distance and average speed are recorded on the LilyGO smartwatch. The event begins when user pushes "Start" button and ends when user presses "End" button in hiking session view  

**3.step:** An act or movement of putting one leg in front of the other in walking or running  

**4.step count:** An approximation of taken steps computed by a step algorithm based on BMA423 accelerometer data

### Content of the SRS

This SRS has three sections:  

1. **Introduction:** This section provides an overview of the entire SRS. It clarifies the context and the objectives of the Hiking Band System and details essential terminology and references.  
2. **Overall description:** This section provides a high-level overview of the SUD (System Under Development). It details the product functionalities, product perspective, constraints and user characteristics.  
3. **Specific Requirements:** This section delves deeper into the technical details of the SUD. It defines the performance requirements, design constraints, software-system attributes and security considerations. 

### Organization of the SRS

This SRS follows the structure recommended in IEEE 830:1998. Each section builds upon previous sections, ensuring that readers gain solid understanding of the System Under Design (SUD).  

1. **Introduction:** Gives an overview of the product, key terminology and details the purpose and the scope of this SRS  
2. **Overall description:** Provides an extensive overview of the systems requirements and constraints  
3. **Specific Requirements:** Breaks the system down into requirements that can be measured and verified based on preset metrics, ensuring that meeting the requirements can be verified during development and testing stages. 



## Overview schematic

The image below details an overview of the system concept. 

![Initial Concept Overview](dev-doc/consept-overview.png "Initial Concept Overview")

# Overall description

## Product perspective

The product perspective states individual components and their connections within the system. 

![Block diagram showing the major components of the full system and the interconnections between its components. ](dev-doc/consept-overview.png "Block diagram of the system.")

> Note: In the above image, naming and other visualizations used MAY not convey the actual final product. However the interconnections and protocols SHOULD represent the actual system.

Using the above block diagram of the whole system we can divide the interfaces to subsections:

The [System interfaces](#system-interfaces) section lists the methods for software to interact with external systems and major components. 

The [User interfaces](#user-interfaces) section lists the characteristics between the software and the user. 

The [Hardware interfaces](#hardware-interfaces) section lists the characteristics between hardware and software.

The [Software interfaces](#software-interfaces) section lists the characteristics between different software and applications within the system.

The [Communications interfaces](#communications-interfaces) section lists the characteristics between different software and applications within the system.

### System interfaces

The system MUST be accessible by the use of the external resources:

- Local network
- Web Browser

The data exchange between the major components MUST happen with structured and coherent application level protocol:

- HTTP and tcp/ip protocols between the web browser and the Web Application
- HTTP-like protocol between the Web Application and the LilyGo Application

The LilyGo Application SHOULD NOT execute its functions without interaction from the user or the Web Application. This means the LilyGo Application has only slave-like properties within the system.

The Web Application SHOULD be able to interact with its resources and the system independently.

### User interfaces

The LilyGO interface user MUST be able to interact with the functionalities:

- "start a hiking session"
- "stop a hiking session"
- "display step count on display"
- "display travelled distance on display"
- "record step count"
- Enable BlueTooth capabilities 

The LilyGO interface SHOULD follow the given interface layout:

![LilyGo Views](/dev-doc/app_views.png "concept of app views")


> Note: the GUI of the final product may not be a one to one match with the early visualization draft represented here. It will however meet the requirements for functionalities.


The Web UI interface user MUST be able to interact with the functionalities:

- "display a list of past sessions"
- "display the last session"

The Web UI interface SHOULD follow the given interface layout:

![Web UI views](/dev-doc/web_ui_view.png "concept of web view")

### Hardware interfaces

The LilyGO application MUST use the touchScreen FT6336 using the pinout defined by LilyGO hardware:

- SDA: 23 pin
- SCL: 32 pin
- Interrupt: 38 pin

The LilyGO application MUST use the BMA423 using the pinout defined by LilyGO hardware:

- Interrupt: 39 pin

The WebUI HTML layout MUST be viewable in a web browser on Raspberry Pi. In this context viewable means that the user MUST be able to read all information rendered on a web page

The WebUI HTML layout MAY be viewable on a mobile phone screen. 

### Software interfaces

The LilyGO application SHOULD use LilyWatch maintained TTGO_TWatch_Library for the pin definitions and driver implementation 

The Web application SHOULD use SQLite to store synchronized data locally on the RPi

The Web application SHOULD use SQLite to store its information

### Communications interfaces

The synchronization SHOULD be able to happen only after initial setup between RPi and LilyGO

The synchronization via BlueTooth between RPi and LilyGO MUST happen via BlueTooth v4.2 or below

The WebUI MUST use http protocol within a local TCP/IP network.

The RPi MUST be able to connect to a local network OR host its own access point to view the WebUI

This SRS details the requirements for the proof-of-concept (poc) version of the system under design (SUD). The system SHOULD be in a stage in which users with intermediate technical skills with Smartwatches, Bluetooth technology and Raspberry Pi product family can use the product indepentently with the help of the project documentation.  

With the help of the documentation the user must be able to know how to 

- clone source code from remote repository (GitHub)
- how to set up virtual environment and install dependencies
- how to flash firmware on LilyGO T-Watch



## Constraints

### System interfaces

- The TWatch has a touchscreen that works as the user interface
- The RPi has a monitor, mouse and keyboard setup that works as a user interface
- The interface between the RPi and TWatch is a Bluetooth connection

### User interfaces

#### TWatch touchscreen interfaces.

- Default interface, has navigation buttons for viewing past sessions, opening the settings menu and moving to the session screen.
- Settings interface, has buttons for configuring the bluetooth connection
- Past sessions interface, contains the current past 5 sessions
- Session interface, has the start and stop session buttons. Shows the current stats for the session.

#### WebUI interfaces

- Home screen shows top and average values of trips and the last trip you have done
- View with a list of all trips, every trip can be deleted from this view
- Configuration view where the setup for the BT connection is and with what intervalls the RPi tries to connect to it

### Hardware interfaces

- WebUI software will run on a RPi 3 and utilize a standard monitor, mouse and keyboard setup.
- The hiking app will use a TWatch v2. If modified a bit it can also use the versions v1 and v3, if the GPS is disabled.

### Software interfaces

- No external softwares required

### Communications interfaces

- The WebUI can be viewed by connecting to the RPi with RealVNC Viewer over the same network using standard network protocols
- The RPi and the TWatch communicate over Bluetooth using a JSON format

### Memory

- The TWatch will only save 5 trips before it starts rewriting the previous information
- The trips will be saved in flash memory

### Operations

- The user will have to first setup the connection between the RPi and the TWatch before being able to synchronize them
- The user will have to synchronize the Watch after the battery runs low enough that the system clock becomes unreliable
- The user will have to synchronize the Watch before they run out of space for trips that have not been synchronized

### Site adaptation requirements

- The current scope of the project does not see it being used anywhere else, so no additional requirements are necessary

## Assumptions and dependencies

- The LilyGo hiking application requires LilyGO T-Watch V2
- The Web Application requires Python 3.10 or higher
- The web application is only guaranteed to work on Raspberry Pi3 
- The clock is either recharged or synchronized regularly between trips to ensure that the real-time clock module is operational. If the clock runs out of battery life, user may not be able to record new hiking sessions. 


## Apportioning of requirements
