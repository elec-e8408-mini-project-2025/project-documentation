# Course notes


## Introduction

The purpose of this documentation is to gather notes from lecture and course reading that may be of use during the course mini-project or when preparing for the course exam. 


## Validation and verification

> Validation: are we building the right product
> Verification: are we building the product right

## Formal and semi-formal methods

## Software Engineering Principles (Seven principles)

1. **Coincidental.** Parts of a module are not related at all, but simply bundled into a single module.
2. **Logical.** Parts that perform similar tasks are put together in a joint module.
3. **Temporal.** Tasks that execute within the same time span are brought together.
4. **Procedural.** The elements of a module make up a single control sequence.
5. **Communicational.** All elements of a module act on the same area of a data structure.
6. **Sequential.** The output of one part in a module serves as input for another part.
7. **Functional.** Each part of a module is necessary for the execution of a single function.
